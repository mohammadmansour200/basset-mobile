# Privacy Policy for Basset

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025

Thank you for using Basset! This privacy policy explains how our application handles your data. Our
core principle is simple: **we do not collect any of your personal data.**

Basset is a free, open-source media toolkit for Android that performs all operations entirely on
your device.

## 1. Core Privacy Principle: No Data Collection

Basset is designed to be fully functional without an internet connection.

* **No Data Collected:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, media files, or
  metadata.
* **Offline Operation:** All operations (compression, conversion, and trimming) are performed
  locally on your device.
* **No Server Interaction:** Your files and data are never uploaded to any external server, cloud
  service, or third party.

## 2. Information We Process (Locally)

To perform its functions, Basset needs to access and process your media files locally. "Processing"
in this context means performing operations *only* on your device.

* **User-Selected Media:** The app only accesses media files (images, audio, and video) that you
  explicitly select from your device's storage for an operation.
* **Media Metadata:** The app reads basic metadata from your files (e.g., title, duration, file
  size, bitrate) for the sole purpose of displaying it to you within the app. This metadata is never
  stored, shared, or transmitted.
* **Processed Media:** Files generated by the app (e.g., compressed images, trimmed videos) are
  saved directly to your device's standard media directories (such as `Music`, `Pictures`, or
  `Movies`) using the Android MediaStore API. You have full control over these files.

## 3. Permissions

Basset requests a minimal set of permissions to function.

* **Storage Access (`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`):** This permission is **only** required for devices
  running **Android 9 (API 28) or older**. It is necessary for the app to save your processed (
  compressed, converted, or trimmed) files to your device's storage.
* **Android 10+ (Scoped Storage):** On devices running Android 10 (API 29) and newer, Basset uses
  the Scoped Storage framework. This means it **does not require** the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
  permission and can only save files to standard media collections, which is a more privacy-friendly
  approach.
* **No Network Permission:** The app does not request or require any network or internet
  permissions, reinforcing that no data can be sent from your device.

## 4. Data Storage and Deletion

* **Input Files:** Your original media files are read-only and are not modified, moved, or deleted
  by the app.
* **Output Files:** Processed files are saved to your device's storage. You are in complete control
  of these files and can delete them at any time using your device's file manager or gallery app.
* **Temporary Files:** In the event an operation fails, any partial or temporary files created
  during the process are automatically cleaned up and deleted.

## 5. Open-Source Software

Basset is fully open-source and licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**. You
are free to inspect, audit, and contribute to the source code to verify all the claims in this
policy.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future, primarily to reflect any new features while
maintaining our core privacy commitment. Any changes will be posted in the updated application and
source code repository.
